    <h1>The Stoic Dichotomy of Control, and an Anatomy of Thought</h1>

    <p>
        While this post is not meant to be a full overview of the history of Stoicism,
        a brief background may be of use.
    </p>


    <h2 id="dichotomy">
        The Dichotomy of Control<a href="#dichotomy"></a>
    </h2>

    <blockquote>
        The chief task in life is simply this: to <b>identify and separate matters</b> so that I can say clearly to
        myself which are externals <b>not under my control</b>, and which have to do with the 
        <b>choices I actually control</b>.
        <br>
        <br>
        ~Epictetus (The Discourses)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The Stoic dichotomy of control is, simply put, the idea that things are either within our control or not.
        This distinction is valid not only for thoughts, but experience, actions, goals, and most aspects of life.
    </p>

    <h3 id="control">
        What's within my control?<a href="#control"></a>
    </h3>

    <blockquote>
        Some things are in our control and others not.
        Things in our control are opinion, pursuit, desire, aversion, and, in a word, whatever are our own actions.
        Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word, whatever are not our own
        actions.
        <br>
        <br>
        ~Epictetus (The Enchiridion)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        The Stoics draw the line of what is within our control around the direct actions we take,
        specifically excluding any experience and outcomes/results of action.
        While most outcomes are able to be influenced, only those aspects in which you exert influence are within your
        control.
    </p>

    <h4 id="control-body">Body<a href="control-body"></a></h4>
    <p>
        As an example from the quote above, let's look at "body".
        The Stoics would label a healthy body as a "preferred indifference", meaning it is something one can prefer,
        but not at the expense of living a virtuous life.
        Knowing what we know today about the body,
        there are plenty of aspects that are outside of our control (genes, bodily harm from accidents, etc.),
        as well as plenty of aspects within our control (diet, exercise, choosing to get vaccinated, etc.).
    </p>

    <h4 id="control-emotions">Emotions<a href="control-emotions"></a></h4>
    
    <blockquote>
        If you are <b>distressed</b> by anything external, the pain is
        <b>not due to the thing itself, but to your estimate of it;</b> and this you have the
        <b>power to revoke</b> at any moment.
        <br>
        <br>
        ~Marcus Aurelius (Meditations)
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        Another key aspect of life this can be applied to is emotions.
        While emotions themselves are not within our control, our response to them is.
        Once you feel a strong negative emotion coming on, what do you about it;
        let it fester and grow, or nip it at the bud?
    </p>
    <p>
        The Stoics make a clear distinction between (negative) emotions and reasoning,
        pointing out that emotions cloud your reasoning skills, and reasoning can help clear your head of emotions.
    </p>
    <p>
        The opposite can be said for positive emotions. Making the distinction and reasoning about which emotions you
        foster and which you don't is fully within your control.

    <p>
        The key to the dichotomy of control is to focus your thoughts and energy towards those aspects of life over
        which you have control, while maintaining an indifference towards those aspects over which you do not have
        control.
