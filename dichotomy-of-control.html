                The chief task in life is simply this: to <b>identify and separate matters</b>
                so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals <b>not under my control</b>,
                and which have to do with the <b>choices I actually control</b>.

                The Stoic dichotomy of control is, simply put,
                the idea that things are either within our control or not.
                This distinction is valid not only for thoughts,
                but experience, actions, goals, and most aspects of life.

                    whatever are our own actions.
                    Things not in our control are body, property, reputation, command, and, in one word,
                    whatever are not our own actions.

                <p>
                    The Stoics draw the line of what is within our control around the direct actions we take,
                    specifically excluding any experience and outcomes/results of action.
                    While most outcomes are able to be influenced,
                    only those aspects in which you exert influence are within your control.

                        As an example from the quote above, let's look at "body".
                        The Stoics would label a healthy body as a "preferred indifference",
                        meaning it is something one can prefer,
                        but not at the expense of living a virtuous life.
                        Knowing what we know today about the body,
                        there are plenty of aspects that are outside of our control
                        (genes, bodily harm from accidents, etc.),
                        as well as plenty of aspects within our control
                        (diet, exercise, choosing to get vaccinated, etc.).

                    <p>
                        Another key aspect of life this can be applied to is emotions.
                        While emotions themselves are not within our control, our response to them is.
                        Once you feel a strong negative emotion coming on, what do you about it;
                        let it fester and grow, or nip it at the bud?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Stoics make a clear distinction between (negative) emotions and reasoning,
                        pointing out that emotions cloud your reasoning skills, and reasoning can help
                        clear your head of emotions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The opposite can be said for positive emotions. Making the distinction and
                        reasoning about which emotions you foster and which you don't is fully within your control.

                    The key to the dichotomy of control is to focus your thoughts, energy, goals, etc.
                    towards those aspects of life over which you have control,
                    while maintaining an indifference towards those aspects over which you do not have control.

                <p>
                    According to Wikipedia, mindfulness is
                    "the practice of purposely bringing one's attention in the present moment without judgment".
                    This can be achieved through dedicated, deliberate practice such as meditation.
                    However, a similar result may be achieved by simply reflecting on the day and the moments in which
                    you would have acted differently if you could go back.
                    The important part here is focusing on the moment itself, not on wishing you had acted differently
                    or gotten a different result.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the example of the body, maybe you convinced yourself to skip working out that day,
                    or to indulge in an unhealthy behavior.
                    Reflecting on that fact, and going back to the moment in the day you made the decision,
                    what were the thoughts going your head?
                    Maybe it was how tired you were, or the fact that there's always tomorrow, or "just this once"
                    (for the umpteenth time).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Or using the example of emotions, if you let a negative emotion get the better of you,
                    what did it <i>feel like</i> to in that moment?
                    Was there a tightness in your chest, a clenching of your fist, racing thoughts?
                </p>
                <p>
                    The simple act of reflecting on moments and determining the characteristics
                    that lead to the negative action makes you aware of them,
                    which can help prepare you for the next time.
                    Keeping an eye out for those characteristics in your daily life is fully within your control.

                <p>
                    Being able to break things down into smaller parts can help you find the aspects
                    over which you have control, which can help you guide your attention towards them.
                    The act of having this "algorithm" or "filter" you consciously apply to aspects of thoughts helps
                    train your brain to do it automatically, subconsciously.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is just one of many mental models that can help guide your thinking 
                    towards making better decisions and living a happier life.
                    What other mental models are you already using subconsciously?
